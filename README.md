# Signal Preprocessing Library

This library provides a modular and extensible framework for preprocessing multichannel signal data. It includes tools for windowing, digital filtration, and feature extraction, along with a manager class to coordinate these preprocessing tasks.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Each preprocessing task is encapsulated in a dedicated class.
- **Windowing**: Apply windowing schemes with overlap to multichannel signals.
- **Digital Filtration**: Add customizable filters, including low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from signal data using time-domain methods.
- **Task Manager**: Easily manage and chain preprocessing tasks for streamlined processing.
- **Visualisation**: Visualise signal data using Plotly.

## Installation

Dependencies:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Plotly: (Optional)
